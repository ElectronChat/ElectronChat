DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH DOTENV FOR THE FRONT END

Dot env is too complicated of s setup since these are static webpages and dotenv needs
to be accessed at runtime.

Instead, I used the port and ip selected with setup.py to create the environment variable files

Then it is accessible for angular since its set at compile time

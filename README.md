# ElectronChat

This is the source code for an end to end encrypted chatroom webapp. Using this readme, you should be able to
setup your work space to run the server for this webapp and, in your browser, use it.

Before use, make sure you have Node JS installed on your system. Node JS can be found at: https://nodejs.org/en/. If possible, download the LTS version 16.17.X.

Next have Python 3 installed so you can run the setup script provide which should make setup very easy.
Python 3 can be found at: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once both Node JS and Python 3 are installed, you can open your terminal in the "ElectronChat" folder. You should see 'setup.py' if you use the 'ls' command.

Run the 'python3 setup.py' command.

After a little while, your project should be all setup and you can navigate to the "back-end-main folder"

Once in the "back-end-main" folder, run 'node index.js'. The server should be up and running.

You can now go to 'localhost:8080' to use the app.

Thank you for checking out our project!

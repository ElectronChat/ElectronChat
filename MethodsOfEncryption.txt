Ideas about the method for encryption - Philip Marshall - October 10th 2022

For encryption, we could use symmetric key encryption since it fits our use case very well. 
Symmetric encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt messages
so it would work perfectly with out room code being the key.

I have the most experience with AES encryption algorithm which is one of many symmetric encryption algorithms. 
I would suggest using AES, but there are other good options as well.

Regardless of what we decide to do, I believe we should implement encryption last 
since its going to be easy to modify the code to account for it.
It will also be easier to debug when messages are not encrypted.
